The current trends in computer architecture are increasingly focusing on sharing
computing resources among multiple programs and processes. Multi-thread and multi-core
processors are commonplace in personal computers and mobile phones, even embedded devices.
In cloud computing, technologies like virtual machines and virtual environments are
allowing multiple different programs to share the same computing resources.
These shared resources include all the structures inside cores and multi-core processors
which can be accessed simultaneously by threads colocated on a single core, or even processes
on two different cores. This poses a threat to the data security of many critical
processes which run in such a shared context.

Attackers with the right knowledge and tools
can leverage hardware implementation flaws in the design of these shared resources
to extract data from a victim process via undetectable side-channels. Malicious trojans
can use these shared resources to construct covert-channels to establish inter-process
communication undetectable by the core or OS. With the rapid increase of need of
powerful computation resources, GPUs have been extended to support general purpose computing.
More recently, multiple processes are able to share the GPGPU resource
and this opens up a new domain of security attacks which can be mounted on GPGPUs.

With the recent Meltdown \Citeref{meltdown} and Spectre \Citeref{spectre} attacks capable of compromising any Intel core 
regardless of the OS, it is obvious that along with power and performance, design of
computer architecture needs to consider data security as an important metric.
Moreover, a lot of software based attacks like buffer overflow and return-oriented
programming can be thwarted effectively using additional hardware structures.
Hardware support for security against software exploits is an efficient mitigation
and should also be considered when designing processors.\\
\\

In this report, an outline of recent security attack methods and mitigations
on both CPU and GPGPU is presented. The attacks range from side-channels and covert-channels over
various CPU resources to different types of return-oriented programming exploits.
Hardware-based mitigations and their effectiveness over software implementations is shown.
The literature survey is followed with an implementation of cache reverse-engineering procedure
and results.

%This document contains commonly used essential templates to write a
%\LaTeX\ document. This document is to be used along with the files and
%folders provided. Writing a \LaTeX\ document is very simple.  Often
%students need only very simple constructs.  This document shows
%certain essential features that almost all technical report writing
%requires. Please consult the PDF file for the output of the document,
%and then look at the corresponding \LaTeX\ file to reproduce it.  The
%document illustrates the following constructs
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Unnumbered and numbered Lists
%\item Equations
%\item Defining short macros for frequently used symbols
%\item Bibliography
%\item Figures
%\item Tables
%\end{itemize}
%
%The normal procedure for compiling a \LaTeX\ document that contains
%bibliographic entries is to follow the following steps
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \verb|pdflatex mainrep|
%\item \verb|bibtex mainrep|
%\item \verb|pdflatex mainrep|
%\item \verb|pdflatex mainrep|
%\end{enumerate}
%In the above example \verb|mainrep| is the main \LaTeX\ file.

%\section{First section of this chapter}
%
%This is the first chapter, which resides in a directory (folder)
%intro. Each chapter can contain \verb|section|, \verb|subsection|
%and so on.
%
%\subsection{Equations and Math symbols}
%
%
%Equations should be set in a separate mode.  For details on getting
%various types of aligned equations, consult the \AmS-\LaTeX\
%documentation \verb|amsldoc.pdf|. Simple equations are set as
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:sinx}
%\int \mathrm{d}x \; \cos x =  \sin x
%\end{equation}
%Equation~\eqref{eq:sinx} is the integral of the cosine
%function. Mathematical symbols must always be put inside \verb|$$|,
%when they appear outside a math environment (such as \verb|equation|,
%\verb|align|, \verb|gather|, etc).  The symbol ``ex'' must be written as
%$x$ and not as x.  
%
%Another commonly used construct for equations is the \verb|align|
%environment to align several equations along a vertical line. It is
%usually the $=$ sign across which the alignment is done.  The
%point of alignment for each equation is specified using the ampersand symbol 
%\begin{align}
%a &= b  \\
%a + e + f + g & = m + n + z \\
%x + 2 & = x^{3} + 3 x^{2} + 2 x + 5
%\end{align}
%
%\subsection{Commonly used Symbols}
%For mathematical symbols it is very convenient to define frequently
%used symbols as a short macro. For example if you are to be using the
%symbol $\eta_{\mathrm{s}}$ frequently it is convenient to define it in
%as:\\
%\verb|\newcommand{\etas}{\ensuremath{\eta_{\mathrm{s}}}}| \\
%in the preamble and to simply refer it to in the text as \etas\ or in
%a mathematical equation as $\etas = \eta \, ( 1 + \phi)$.

%\section{How to write nomenclature} 
%
%\subsection{General guidelines:}
%\begin{enumerate}	
%	\item Use \verb|\nomenclature[prefix]{symbol}{description}| for symbols, the best place for this command is immediately after you introduce the symbol for the first time
%	\item Shorten the long command:\\ \verb|\newcommand{\nm}[2]{\nomenclature{#1}{#2}}|
%	\item Create compiler for nomenclature with the given code: \\
%	\textbf{makeindex \%.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o \%.nls -t \%.nlg }\\
%	For TeXstudio: go to options > build > user command > write- `user1: Nomenclature' amd paste the above code\\
%	For compiling the nomenclature: go to tools > user > Nomenclature	
%\end{enumerate}	
%
%\subsection{Grouped nomenclature}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item For acronyms, use:\\
% \verb|\nmA[sorting letter]{symbol}{descritpon}|
%\item For roman symbols, use:\\
%\verb|\nmR[sorting letter]{symbol}{descritpon}|
%\item For greek symbols, use:\\
% \verb|\nmG[sorting letter]{symbol}{descritpon}|
% \item For superscripts, use:\\
% \verb|\nmS[sorting letter]{symbol}{descritpon}|
% \item For subscripts, use:\\
% \verb|\nms[sorting letter]{symbol}{descritpon}| 
% \item For any other symbol, use:\\
% \verb|\nmX[sorting letter]{symbol}{descritpon}|\\
% Name of other symbols can be changed with \verb|\OtherSym{Name of symbols}|
%\end{enumerate}
%%%
%\subsection{Some examples}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \verb|\nmA[FF]{FFA}{Free fatty acid}|
%\item \verb|\nmA[AO]{AOR}{Angle of repose}|
%\item \verb|\nmR[Ra]{$R$}{Radius of circle}|
%\item \verb|\nmR[ra]{$r$}{Intrinsic length}|
%\item \verb|\nmR[Gr]{$G_\mathrm{r}$}{Gravity}|
%\item \verb|\nmG[al]{$\alpha_{\mathrm{a}}$}{Angular acceleration}|
%\item \verb|\nmG[et]{$\eta$}{Viscosity}|
%\item \verb|\nmG[be]{$\beta$}{Shape factor}|
%\item \verb|\nmS[v]{$v$}{Vapor phase}|
%\item \verb|\nmS[g]{$g$}{Gas phase}|
%\item \verb|\nms[i]{$i$}{Indices}|
%\item \verb|\nms[x]{$x$}{Variable in x-direction}|
%\item \verb|\nmX[f]{foo}{foo|

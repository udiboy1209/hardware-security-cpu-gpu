\chapter{Conclusion}

As we saw above, the recent advances in computer architecture for performance
and power gains leads to introduction of a series of leakages from the
processor which is a security concern. It is required to design hardware by
keeping security in mind as the processors get more and more complex in order
to extract higher performance gains. The industry runs a lot of
security critical applications which if broken can cause many problems. It is
important for us to keep in mind the existance of such side channels to ensure
minimal leakage of sensitive data.
